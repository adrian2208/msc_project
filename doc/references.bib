We also remark that the center of the gauge group does not seem very relevant for this result; chiral symmetry breaking is a property of strong-coupling lattice theories both in the case where quark color is confined, and also in the case where it is screened by gauge field fluctuations.}

As a consequence, it is possible to find explicit formulae for the Levi-Civita connection and the various curvatures, especially in the case of metrics which are both left- and right-invariant.",

The massless states arise as zero modes bound to the mass defect, and all doublers can be given large gauge invariant masses. The manner in which the anomalies are realized is transparent: apparent chiral anomalies in the 2n-dimensional subspace correspond to charge flow into the extra dimension.},

But the stake is high: the FP action has scale invariant instanton solutions, has no topological artifacts, satisfies the index theorem on the lattice, does not allow exceptional configurations, requires no tuning to get the pion massless and is expected to reduce the cut-off effects significantly. An overview is given including a discussion on tests in Yang-Mills theory, QCD and d = 2 spin and gauge models.}

It builds upon the TikZ package and leverages the graph placement algorithms from TikZ in order to automate the placement of many vertices.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU GPL v3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 6727 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 413779 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: TeX, LaTeX, Lua. Computer: PC’s or workstations. Operating system: Any capable of processing LaTeX. Classification: 4.4. External routines: TikZ Nature of problem: Existing methods for drawing Feynman diagrams in LaTeX usually require external programs and are not very user friendly thereby making it difficult and time consuming to generate even simple diagrams. Solution method: TikZ-Feynman provides an easier way to draw Feynman diagrams by building on TikZ and using graph drawing algorithms to automatically place vertices. This can be combined with some positioning to produce complicated diagrams with relative ease. Running time: Depends on the size}

abstract = {We propose a method to improve lattice operators composed of Wilson fermions which allows the removal of all corrections of O(a), including those proportional to the quark mass, leaving only errors of O(a2). The method exploits the fact that chiral symmetry is restored at short distances. By imposing this requirement on correlation functions of improved lattice operators at short distances, the coefficients which appear in these operators can be determined. The method is an extension of the improvement program of the Alpha collaboration, which, up to now, has only been applicable in the chiral limit. The extension to quarks with non-zero masses is particularly important for applications in heavy quark physics.}

Numerical studies of two-flavour QCD now suggest that the low quark modes are locally coherent to a certain extent. As a consequence, the modes can be simultaneously deflated, using local projectors, with a total computational effort proportional to the lattice volume (rather than its square). Deflation has potentially many uses in lattice QCD. The technique is here worked out for the case of quark propagator calculations, where large speed-up factors and a flat scaling behaviour with respect to the quark mass are achieved.}

Using these facts, we derive a formula that relates the small flow-time behavior of certain gauge-invariant local products and the correctly-normalized conserved energy–momentum tensor in the Yang–Mills theory. Our formula provides a possible method to compute the correlation functions of a well-defined energy–momentum tensor by using lattice regularization and Monte Carlo simulation.}",

abstract = {Non-singlet chiral Ward identities for fermionic operators at positive flow-time are derived using standard techniques based on local chiral variations of the action and of local operators. The gradient flow formalism is applied to twisted mass fermions and it is shown that automatic O(a) improvement for Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist is a property valid also at positive flow-time. A definition of the chiral condensate that is multiplicatively renormalizable and automatically O(a) improved is then derived.}

abstract = {Ward identities of BRS or nil-potent type are derived which express the content of local gauge invariance for stochastically quantized gauge theories. First the Langevin equation for stochastically quantized non-abelian gauge theories with gauge fixing is shown to be invariant under a restricted class of local, classical gauge transformations. Next the solution of the Langevin equation is expressed as a functional integral with a local action which is shown to be invariant under the restricted classical gauge transformations. Grassmann variables or ghosts are introduced which make the action invariant under a nil-potent transformation. They play no dynamical role, but only serve as a book-keeping device to calculate the BRS transform of non-ghost amplitudes. (All closed ghost loops vanish.) Finally the Ward identities are solved to obtain the renormalized action and restrictions on renormalization constants.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,062 new measurements from 721 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including new reviews on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group （http：//pdg. lbl. gov）. The printed PDG Book contains the Summary Tables and all review articles but no longer includes the detailed tables from the Particle Listings. A Booklet with the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the review articles is also available.},
